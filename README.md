# Pine Script Examples and Custom Indicators/Strategies

This project contains a collection of basic Pine Script examples and custom indicators/strategies that I've developed using the Pine Script programming language.

## Contents

- **Basic Examples**: Simple code snippets demonstrating what you can achieve with Pine Script. These examples are great for beginners looking to get familiar with Pine Script syntax and functionalities.
- **Custom Indicators**: Pine Script code for custom indicators that I've created to help analyze various market conditions and trading strategies.
- **Custom Strategies**: Scripts for trading strategies that I've developed. These strategies can be applied to different market conditions and tested within TradingView.

## Getting Started

To start working with the scripts in this repository, you can use any code editor of your choice or simply the Trading View Pine Editor. However, for a better development experience, I recommend using [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which supports Pine Script through several useful extensions.

### Recommended VSCode Extensions

For a more efficient and enjoyable coding experience, consider installing the following VSCode extensions:

1. **[IntelliJ IDEA Keybindings](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k--kato.intellij-idea-keybindings)**  
   Provides keybindings familiar to those coming from IntelliJ IDEA, enhancing productivity with shortcuts you're used to.

2. **[Pine Script](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JeylaniB.pinescript)**  
   This extension offers syntax highlighting and basic code completion specifically for Pine Script, making it easier to write and debug scripts.

3. **[Pine Script Syntax Highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ex-codes.pine-script-syntax-highlighter)**  
   Another useful extension that provides enhanced syntax highlighting, helping you quickly identify different elements of Pine Script code.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in VSCode.
3. Install the recommended extensions for a better coding experience.
4. Explore the examples and custom scripts. You can modify them to fit your trading needs.
5. Copy the scripts into TradingView to use them as indicators or strategies on your charts.
